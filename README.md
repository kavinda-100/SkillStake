# SkillStake

## Project Description

SkillStake is a decentralized skill-based challenge platform that allows users to create, participate in, and resolve challenges in a trustless and transparent way. Users can stake on their own or others’ challenges, submit proof of completion, and engage in community voting to determine outcomes. The platform handles staking, reward distribution, and platform fees securely on-chain, while providing real-time updates and a seamless experience across web and mobile applications.
